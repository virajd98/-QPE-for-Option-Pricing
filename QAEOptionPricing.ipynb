    "**Theoretical Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Financial options are contracts that give the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a financial instrument (such as stocks) at a predetermined price (strike) before or at the expiration date.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand this with a simple example: Suppose an option contract (containing a fixed number of shares of a certain stock) is bought when the underlying stock is worth $X$ with a target/strike price for the stock at $K$ (here $K>X$) and an expiration date of $3$ years. The buyer pays a premium to the seller to purchase this contract. Within these three years, the price of this option changes due to the stochastic nature of the stock prices underlying it. If on or before the period of $3$ years the stock price crosses the threshold of $K$ and reaches the price $S$ ($S$ is called the payoff and here $S>K$) the contract buyer exercises his right to buy the stock at the predetermined target price $Y$. In this process the buyer makes a profit of $S-K$ (minus the premium paid, for net profit). If the stock price remains below $K$ on or before the expiry date, the buyer won't exercise the contract and would suffer a loss of the premium amount paid to the seller.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of option pricing is to figure out how much an option will be worth when it reaches its end date in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Pay-off of an Option**\n",
    "The expectation value of the payoff $E_P[f(X)]$ as an average across all prices paths is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}[f(\\mathbf{X})]=\\sum_{i=1}^{M} p_{i} f\\left(\\mathbf{X}_{i}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $p_{i}$ is the probability of realizing the price path $i$. $\\mathbf{X_i}$ is a column vector with $N$ rows (representing $N$ assets in the contract) and indicates a specific price path."
